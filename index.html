        <h1>My Front End Diary</h1>
        <p>This is my Front End diary where I will register my progress 
           and my impressions as I move along in this Web Development course. 
           This is also my first website. </p>
        <h2>Blog</h2>
        <p>The blog will include the challenges I face during my first attempt with programming
            but also the small achievements I reach.
